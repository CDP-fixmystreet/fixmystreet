            <h2>Your residents, working for you</h2>
            <p>When even a small percentage of your residents have access to FixMyStreet from their smartphone, it makes a big difference.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, you have eyes and ears everywhere, ready to report streetscene issues wherever they are encountered.</p>
            <p>FixMyStreet turns those users into experts, filing reports with the information you need to get the problems fixed. Reports automatically include detailed location data. Residents may also add a photograph to help you identify and assess the issue.</p>

            <h2>Appy days</h2>
            <p>Your residents want to report faults as they see them, so FixMyStreet for Councils is available as an app for iPhones and Android. </p>
            <p>Additionally, it can be accessed via any smartphone browser, as a mobile-optimised website.</p>
            <p>But there may not be great data coverage in every part of your borough. That's fine: the FixMyStreet for Councils apps also allow users to make a report on site; it then saves it and sends it off once there is access to a connection.</p>

            <h2>Beyond councils</h2>
            <p>FixMyStreet is flexible software: it can be adapted for any use that relies on people pinpointing a location on a map. That might include crime reporting, bird spotting, or any other type of crowdsourced, map-based project.</p>
            <p>For example, reporting empty homes (an award-winning website and iPhone app for Channel 4 and the Empty Homes Agency); anti-social behaviour (See Something Say Something, an iPhone and Android app for the West Midlands Safer Travel Partnership); vaccine stock shortage (a website, currently in development, for reporting when TB clinics in Delhi have run out of medicine).</p>
