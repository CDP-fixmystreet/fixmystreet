<dl>
    <dt>What is FixMyStreet?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            FixMyStreet is an easy to use web site to help people report, view, or discuss
            local problems to their council by simply locating them on a map.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have now integrated FixMyStreet with the Oxfordshire County Council website
            to make it easier for our customers to report highways faults directly to us by
            using their computer or mobile phone.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>What sort of problems should I report with FixMyStreet?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            FixMyStreet is primarily for reporting things which are broken or dirty, damaged
            or dumped, and need fixing, cleaning or clearing, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Abandoned vehicles
            <li>Dog Fouling
            <li>Flyposting or graffiti
            <li>Flytipping or litter
            <li>Streetcleaning, such as broken glass in a cycle lane
            <li>Unlit lampposts
            <li>Potholes
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>What isn&rsquo;t FixMyStreet for?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            FixMyStreet is not a way of getting in touch with the council for all issues &mdash; please use
            FixMyStreet only for problems highlighted above.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we often route problems via our cleansing services or highways departments, using FixMyStreet
            for other matters may result in a delay in your report getting to the right people.

    <dt>How do I use the FixMyStreet site?</dt>
    <dd>
        After entering a postcode or location, you will then be presented with a map of that area.
        You can then view problems already reported in that area, or report new ones of your own
        simply by clicking on the map at the location of the problem.
    </dd>

    <dt>How are the problems solved?</dt>
    <dd>
        They are reported to us automatically. We then resolve the problem the way we
        normally would and update the fault on the map.
    </dd>

    <dt>What does the map show?</dt>
    <dd>
        The map shows all faults submitted online through FixMyStreet. You can view the
        exact location of each fault and see its current status.
    </dd>

    <dt>How can I get an update on a fault?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            When you record a fault you can sign up to receive updates. You will then receive
            an initial email to acknowledge the report. In time, you will receive a further email
            when the problem is assigned for inspection, one if the problem needs to be referred
            to another department or organisation, and a final email when it is fixed or requires
            no further work.
        </p>
        <p>
            These updates will also be posted on the mapped fault so that anyone can see the
            status of any fault recorded via FixMyStreet by clicking on it on the map.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Can I use FixMyStreet on my mobile?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            Yes, you can view our website on your phone and it will automatically adapt
            to the size of your screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following apps are also available for the national FixMyStreet site,
            and they plan to release updated native apps in the near future.

    <dd>
        The maps FixMyStreet uses are from Ordnance Survey who based their grid reference
